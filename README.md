 Key Insights
1. Workforce Size & Work Mode
We have a total of 9,430 active employees. A majority—over 60%—are working on-site, while around 30% are in hybrid roles and just under 10% work fully remote. This suggests there's still a strong preference or operational need for in-person collaboration, but there's also a growing hybrid culture.

2. Departmental Breakdown
Engineering is the largest department, making up about 35% of the workforce, followed by Sales at 25%. Finance and HR each account for 15%, and Marketing rounds it out with 10%. We’re seeing a high concentration of Technical Contributor and High Performer roles in Engineering and Sales, indicating these areas are critical to business performance.

3. Salary Comparison
There’s a clear gap between average salaries for core roles ($104K) and support roles ($86K). That’s roughly a 21% difference, which reflects the strategic weight placed on front-line or technical roles in the company.

4. Gender Diversity
The gender split is reasonably balanced: 53% male, 41% female, and 6% identifying as other. Interestingly, female employees have the highest average salary across the board ($102K), which is a positive sign in terms of equitable compensation.
